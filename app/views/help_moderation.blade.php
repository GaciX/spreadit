<h2>spreadit moderation</h2>
<p>
spreadit uses decentralized moderation; that is: each user has equal say<br>
there is no moderator per spreadit, nor is there ban happy admins<br>
voting is designed to be able to control any bad/spammy users through the <a href="/help/points">point system</a><br>
it is your responsibility to downvote spam and otherwise shit content<br>
