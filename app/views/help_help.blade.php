<h2>How to Help</h2>
<p>
spreadit is in need of help!<br><br>
we run totally as a hobby, and has a lot of room for improvement!<br>
<ul>
    <li>Are you a coder? Know php or javascript? Try tacking one of the <a href="https://github.com/spreadit/spreadit/issues">issues</a> we have open</li>
    <li>Are you a designer, or work with interfaces? Post some suggestions or mockups in <a href="https://spreadit.io/s/spreadit">/s/spreadit</a> and we can work together to improve the site.</li>
    <li>Like to break things? Break spreadit and file a bug report either in <a href="https://spreadit.io/s/spreadit">/s/spreadit</a> or our <a href="https://github.com/spreadit/spreadit/issues">github</a><li>
    <li>Do you have writing skills? A lot of the help pages could be improved!</li>
    <li>Want to help grow spreadit? Share the site with others, but more importantly- post interesting content for others to read and comment on</li>
    <li>Interested in making an app? Start a thread and outline some ideas, anything necessary we can add to the <a href="https://spreadit.io/api">api</a> fairly easily</li>
</ul>
